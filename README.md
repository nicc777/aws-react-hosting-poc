# React AWS Hosting Multi-Site Demo (rahms-demo)

Please visit the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/nicc777/aws-react-hosting-poc/wiki) for a full set of Instructions and detailed walk through.

Included in the Wiki is 3 scenario's - hosting a single site on S3, without the Lambda helper, hosting a single site with a Lambda helper and finally hosting more than one React site in the same S3 bucket with a Lambda helper.

The source includes sample AWS CloudFormation templates to setup the experiment yourself. To be honest, the Lambda functions still need some work - I consider this a work-in-progress. But it does work currently, so it's good enough to proof the concept.

I would also be very willing to add additional references, should anyone have any suggestions. The details are [explained on the Wiki...](https://github.com/nicc777/aws-react-hosting-poc/wiki/Implementation-Discussion#references)

I am sure this is far from a perfect example, but I am learning and willing to learn from the community.

Thanks, and I really hope this can perhaps help someone else as well.
